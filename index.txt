About me

Hello, I'm Yunus Emre Akdik. I graduated from the International Trade and Business Administration department and started my career in e-commerce. After managing my own international store on Etsy for 2 years, I also handled the foreign trade of a local store for 1 year.

I am open to learning and constantly improving myself. Thanks to my quick learning ability and continuous development goals, I was accepted to Ecole 42, a renowned advanced level software school, where I am currently studying. With my analytical and creative thinking skills, I aim to develop myself in e-commerce and software development fields.
